# Password Generator

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

The software was developed with the main goal of fully utilizing the amazing customTkinter library. With it, it's possible to create modern and sophisticated interfaces.

- Currently, the program allows you to generate passwords up to 40 characters long.
- You can customize your password according to your preferences, including uppercase letters, lowercase letters, special characters, and numbers.
- The functionality to save passwords is not available, only generating new passwords.
- You can copy the generated password directly to the clipboard.
